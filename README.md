# TicTacToe
Project[0]

Game of noughts and crosses created using JavaScript and jQuery. Also utilises the repository SweetAlert from
t4t5 on GitHub, however adjustments have been made in the SweetAlert css and Javascript to adjust styling to suit the
application.

Would love to add: 
- a feature for making the computer play the game
- a counter for the number of games played
- a feature at the start to ask whether it will be a 1 player game or a 2 player game and if it is a 2 player game
ask the names of the players and store them so that later in the game when the winner is chosen it will say their
name
- a different style of box for the instructions to appear in
